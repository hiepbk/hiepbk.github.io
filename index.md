I am Hoang Anh Hiep (Tony), a researcher at DeltaX. Perviously, I obtained my Master of Science degree (2022 - 2024) from the Information Communication Convergence Technology of Soongsil University Department, supervised by Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TARMZOsAAAAJ&hl=vi&oi=ao/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Myungsik Yoo</font></a>. 

My research interests and experiences range from Deep Learning, 3D Perception, 3D scene understanding and reconstruction, Point Cloud and Robotics. I also like to explore meta-learning, constrastive learning, information bottle neck theory and novel learning schemes.  
<br />
Previously I got my B.E. in Control Engineering from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam. During my study in Vietnam, I had great honor to work with Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com.vn/citations?user=c8tp_nAAAAAJ&hl=vi/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Hoang Si Hong</font></a>.
