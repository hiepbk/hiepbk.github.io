I am Hoang Anh Hiep (Tony), an AI researcher at <a href="http://deltax.ai/renewal/eng/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">DeltaX</font></a>. Previously, I obtained my Master of Science degree (2022 - 2024) from the Information Communication Convergence Technology of Soongsil University Department, Seoul, South Korea, supervised by Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TARMZOsAAAAJ&hl=vi&oi=ao/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Myungsik Yoo</font></a>. 


My research interests and experiences range from Deep Learning, 3D Perception, 3D scene understanding and reconstruction, Point Cloud and Robotics. I also like to explore meta-learning, constrastive learning, information bottle neck theory and novel learning schemes.  
<br />
Previously, I got my B.E. in Control Engineering from Hanoi University of Science and Technology, Vietnam. During my undergraduate study, I had great honor to work with Professor <a href="https://sites.usc.edu/quann/" target="_blank"><font color="brown">Quan Nguyen</font></a>, University of Southern California, USA, as a remote internship student in robotics.
